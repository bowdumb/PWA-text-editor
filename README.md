# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

JATE (Just Another Text Editor) is a text editor assembled as a single-page application built using the Progressive Web App (PWA) design. It runs in the browser, and incorporates a variety of data persistence techniques in order to ensure functionality across multiple browsers. Additionally, it can be utilized without an active internet connection.  JavaScript is the core language, and the Node.js JavaScript run-time environment is where all of the tech exists. User data is stored in an IndexedDB database, and the entirety of the project has been deployed via Heroku.

## Installation

In order to install and use the application, there is no need to clone the repository. Instead, simply visit the deployed Heroku URL at <a href="https://young-forest-09742.herokuapp.com/">https://young-forest-09742.herokuapp.com/</a> and click the "Install!" button located in the top-left corner in order to install the application locally within your browser. If using the popular Google Chrome browser, it will be saved within your Chrome Apps directory.

## Usage

Usage is straightforward. When using JATE you are able to write JavaScript functionality into the editor, and it will display the text in a manner that is similar to many common Integrated Development Environments such as Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Some of the features included within this application include:

* The use of IndexedDB to create persistant local database storage

* NPM bundles compiled with the use of Webpack.

* Broad compatibility enabled by the use of the Babel transpiler, as well as async/await functionality provided by the same.
